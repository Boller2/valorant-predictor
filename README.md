# Valorant Prediction Project

This project predicts the outcomes of ranked Valorant games using machine learning. The model is trained based on various factors like the player's performance (K/D ratio, win rate), and the agent's win rate on specific maps.

## Features
- Logistic Regression model for predicting match outcomes (win or lose)
- Integration with the Valorant API to collect player stats and match data
- Web-based interface for viewing predictions and match statistics

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Raw and processed datasets
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experimentation
- **src/**: Main source code for data processing, model training, and predictions
- **tests/**: Unit tests for validating code
- **docs/**: Documentation

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:
