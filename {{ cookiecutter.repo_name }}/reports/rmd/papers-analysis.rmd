## Dynamics of a Large-Scale Spiking Neural Network with Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire Neurons [@ye2021dynamics]
### Introduction
* Since the work of wilson and cowan, the mean-field approximation has become a common method to reduce the network dynamics to the mean firing rate, constructing a low-dimensional mean field model.
* Brunel et al. [-@brunel2000dynamics] derived the mean fiel approximation of the network with interacting excitatory and inhibitory neurons to study the synchonization of the neurons.
* Brunel and Wang built a working memory network and reduced it to a mean-field model to research the computational mechanisms of how the brain stored the information temporarily.
* In the paper, Ye derived a mean-field model from a network of QIF neurons, and analyzed the dynamical properties of the network using bifurcation analysis.

### Results
1. In the synchronization state, the mean-field firing rates are also in agreement with the population firing rates
2. By changing the external input $I_{ext}$ and the excitatory coupling $J_e$, the autor studied the bifurcation plane. Ten regions were found: fold, hopf and period doubling
3. Ye points out that in the synchronized states, the brain could be in a neural state where information is transmited and coded, as synchronization is a way to cope with noise and protect the information.
4. In bistable regime, the network induces persisten activity even after the stimuli has vanished.  This persisten activity "underlies short-term information storage in the brain fuynctions, such as working memory, motor control, and spatial navigation"

**Surprisingly, this paper does not take into account the network topology, nor weighted $J_e$**

## Selective attention model with spiking elements [@chik2009selective]
### Introduction
1. Visual attention in human and monkey brains is realized by a large-scale distributed neural network that includes several cortical and subcortical areas with bottom-up and top-down flow of information between them.
2. **Despite intensive studies of neuronal activity related to attetnion, it is still unclear what neuronal mechanisms are used by the brain to implement attention.**
3. Two types of attentional modulation has been proposed:
	+ Increased excitation of neurons representing attended stimuli is observed while neural activity evoked by unattended stimuli is reduced to a low level.
	+ Gamma range oscillations correlate with the activity of neurons in the attentional focus.

*The model proposed by the authors, using hodgkin-Huxley neurons, aims to elucidate how selective attention can be represented by the synchrony and suppresion of neural activity in a network of interactive spiking elements*



### Results
1. The model exhibits five global dynamical states: Partial synchronization A; Transition state; Global synchronization; Partial synchronization B; Quiescence.  
	1. Partial synchronization is interpreted as selective attention, where population A or B is "attending" to some stimuli.
	2. Transition state is interpreted as different degrees of attention concentration (could be attentional shift?)
2. **There remain many uncertainties abouth the complete bifurcation structure of the model, therefore further investigations are required**
3. In the simulations, selective attention (associated with partial synchronization) always favours a group with higher frequency

```



### Discusion
1. They showed that an inhibitory neuron connected to an assembly of spiking neurons is able to synchronize their activities.
2. When comparing the results of the simulation with experimental data, it was observed that the population of neurons that were "attending" exhibit a higher frequency. This is in line with experiments showing that attention is related with gamma band activity.
3. **Experimental evidence indicates that attention focusing is related to coherent oscillatory spiking activity in the gamma band**.  However, the question about the neuronal mechanism underlying synchronization remains unanswered. The authors discuse two potentail mechanisms, previously proposed by @niebur2002synchrony
	1. Lateral coupling betrween neurons in the population
	2. common input to all neurons in the population.
4. The simulations provide an argument in favour of the second hypothesis, in where a top-down signaling process is stimulated by a bottom-up excitatory signal from the same population, generating a sort of closed loop.
