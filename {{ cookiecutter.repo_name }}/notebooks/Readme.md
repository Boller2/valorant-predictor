# {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} - Notebooks

Here you can find all the notebooks. The naming convention is:

* A number (for ordering),
* The creator's initials, and
* A short `_` delimited description, e.g:

        01_cp_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb

Notebooks will be synced with script files by jupytext and a precommit hook for easier reviewing.
